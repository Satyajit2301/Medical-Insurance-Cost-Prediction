# 🏥 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

This project involves building a predictive model using machine learning to estimate medical insurance charges. The goal is to explore the impact of factors like age, BMI, and smoking habits using regression models.

## 📊 Objective
To develop an accurate regression model using EDA and Linear Regression to predict individual insurance costs.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation

## 📌 Highlights
- Performed EDA to discover feature correlations
- Encoded categorical variables
- Trained Linear Regression model
- Analyzed performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score

## 💡 Insights
- Smoking status has a strong effect on charges
- Higher BMI and age also contribute significantly

## 📚 Next Steps
- Apply other regression models
- Introduce cross-validation
- Deploy model via Streamlit or Flask
